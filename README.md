# Semantic HTML Homework Assignment

## Objectives

This assignment was meant to refactor HTML code into semantic HTML code. I renamed most of the div tags into more acceptable semantic alternatives, including section, article, and aside. I also added accessibility features with adding the "alt" tag to the images.
